Evaluating a postfix expression (also known as Reverse Polish Notation) using a stack is a common algorithmic problem. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to solve it using JavaScript:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Evaluate Postfix Expression using Stack in JavaScript

1. **Understand the Postfix Expression**:
   - A postfix expression is a mathematical expression in which every operator follows all of its operands.
   - For example, the expression `3 4 + 2 * 7 /` corresponds to `((3 + 4) * 2) / 7`.

2. **Initialize a Stack**:
   - Use an array to simulate a stack. This will help in storing operands temporarily.

3. **Read the Expression**:
   - Traverse the postfix expression from left to right.

4. **Process Each Token**:
   - If the token is an operand (a number), push it onto the stack.
   - If the token is an operator, pop the required number of operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.

5. **Final Result**:
   - After processing all tokens, the stack should contain exactly one element, which is the result of the expression.

### JavaScript Code Implementation

Here is a complete and runnable JavaScript code to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack:

```javascript
function evaluatePostfix(expression) {
    // Split the expression into tokens
    const tokens = expression.split(' ');

    // Initialize an empty stack
    const stack = [];

    // Define a helper function to perform arithmetic operations
    const performOperation = (operator, operand1, operand2) => {
        switch (operator) {
            case '+':
                return operand1 + operand2;
            case '-':
                return operand1 - operand2;
            case '*':
                return operand1 * operand2;
            case '/':
                return operand1 / operand2;
            default:
                throw new Error('Unknown operator');
        }
    };

    // Traverse each token in the expression
    for (const token of tokens) {
        if (!isNaN(token)) {
            // If the token is a number, push it onto the stack
            stack.push(parseFloat(token));
        } else {
            // If the token is an operator, pop two operands from the stack
            const operand2 = stack.pop();
            const operand1 = stack.pop();
            // Perform the operation and push the result back onto the stack
            const result = performOperation(token, operand1, operand2);
            stack.push(result);
        }
    }

    // The final result should be the only element left in the stack
    return stack[0];
}

// Example usage
const postfixExpression = '3 4 + 2 * 7 /';
const result = evaluatePostfix(postfixExpression);
console.log(`The result of the postfix expression "${postfixExpression}" is: ${result}`);
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Splitting the Expression**:
   - The expression is split into tokens using `split(' ')`.

2. **Stack Initialization**:
   - An empty array `stack` is initialized to store operands.

3. **Helper Function**:
   - `performOperation` is a helper function that takes an operator and two operands, performs the operation, and returns the result.

4. **Processing Tokens**:
   - The code iterates over each token.
   - If the token is a number, it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If the token is an operator, the top two elements are popped from the stack, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.

5. **Final Result**:
   - After processing all tokens, the stack should contain the final result, which is returned.
