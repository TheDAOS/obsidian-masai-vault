Evaluating a postfix expression (also known as Reverse Polish Notation) using a stack is a common algorithmic problem. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to implement this in JavaScript.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Evaluate Postfix Expression Using Stack in JavaScript

#### Step 1: Understand Postfix Notation
In postfix notation, operators follow their operands. For example, the expression `3 4 +` means `3 + 4`. The evaluation is done from left to right.

#### Step 2: Initialize a Stack
You will need a stack to hold operands as you process the postfix expression.

#### Step 3: Iterate Through the Expression
Loop through each token in the postfix expression. Tokens can be numbers or operators.

#### Step 4: Process Each Token
- If the token is a number, push it onto the stack.
- If the token is an operator (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), pop the required number of operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.

#### Step 5: Final Result
At the end of the iteration, the stack should contain one element, which is the result of the postfix expression.

### Example Code Implementation

Hereâ€™s how you can implement the above steps in JavaScript:

```javascript
function evaluatePostfix(expression) {
    // Initialize an empty stack
    let stack = [];
	
    // Split the expression into tokens
    let tokens = expression.split(' ');
	
    // Iterate through each token
    for (let token of tokens) {
        // Check if the token is a number
        if (!isNaN(token)) {
            // Push the number onto the stack
            stack.push(Number(token));
        } else {
            // The token is an operator
            let b = stack.pop(); // Pop the top element (second operand)
            let a = stack.pop(); // Pop the next element (first operand)
			
            // Perform the operation based on the operator
            switch (token) {
                case '+':
                    stack.push(a + b);
                    break;
                case '-':
                    stack.push(a - b);
                    break;
                case '*':
                    stack.push(a * b);
                    break;
                case '/':
                    stack.push(a / b);
                    break;
                default:
                    throw new Error(`Unknown operator: ${token}`);
            }
        }
    }
	
    // The final result is the only element left in the stack
    return stack.pop();
}

// Example usage
const postfixExpression = "3 4 + 2 * 7 /"; // Equivalent to (3 + 4) * 2 / 7
const result = evaluatePostfix(postfixExpression);
console.log(result); // Output: 1
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Function Definition**: The function `evaluatePostfix` takes a string `expression` as input.
2. **Stack Initialization**: An empty array `stack` is created to hold operands.
3. **Tokenization**: The input string is split into tokens based on spaces.
4. **Loop Through Tokens**: Each token is processed:
   - If it's a number, it's converted to a number and pushed onto the stack.
   - If it's an operator, the top two numbers are popped from the stack, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.
5. **Return Result**: After processing all tokens, the final result is popped from the stack and returned.

### Conclusion
This method efficiently evaluates a postfix expression using a stack data structure. You can test the function with different postfix expressions to see how it works!
