**Apriori Analysis (Mathematical Analysis):** Apriori Analysis is conducted before the algorithm is translated into a program. It involves estimating the running time by counting the number of executions of the dominant operations within the algorithm. This analysis helps in understanding the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of time complexity without the need to run it on actual data.

**Posteriori Analysis:** Posteriori Analysis, on the other hand, is performed after the algorithm has been implemented as a program. Th
