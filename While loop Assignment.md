## Question-1: Divisibility by K using While loop
- You are provided with two numbers stored in variables named `num` and `K`.
- Your task is to print all numbers within the range `[1, num]` for which the number is divisible by `K`.
- A number `i` is divisible by `K` if `i % K == 0`.

##### Input:
The first and the only line of input contains two values, `num` and `K`, stored in the variables respectively.

##### Output:
Print all numbers from 1 to `num` that are divisible by `K`, each on a new line.

##### Sample Input:
```text
7 2
```
â€‹
##### Sample Output:
```text
2 4 6
```

##### Hint:
- In the sample test case, the value stored in `num` is 7, and the value stored in `K` is 2.
- All the values in the range from `[1, 7]`, for which the condition `i % K == 0` is true, are 2, 4, and 6.

## Question-2: Identify Prime using While loop
- You are given a number stored in a variable named `num`.
- Determine if `num` is a prime number. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
- Print "Yes" if `num` is a prime number, otherwise print "No".

##### Input:
The first and the only line of input contains the value stored in `num`.

##### Output:
Print "Yes" if the number is a prime, otherwise print "No".

##### Sample Input:
```text
13
```
