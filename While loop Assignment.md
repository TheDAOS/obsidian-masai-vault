## Question-1: Divisibility by K using While loop
- You are provided with two numbers stored in variables named `num` and `K`.
- Your task is to print all numbers within the range `[1, num]` for which the number is divisible by `K`.
- A number `i` is divisible by `K` if `i % K == 0`.

##### Input:
The first and the only line of input contains two values, `num` and `K`, stored in the variables respectively.

##### Output:
Print all numbers from 1 to `num` that are divisible by `K`, each on a new line.

##### Sample Input:
```text
7 2
```
