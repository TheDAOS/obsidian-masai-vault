## Assignment 1: Filter Even Numbers with `continue`
- **Objective**: Write a JavaScript script using a `for` loop that prints all even numbers from 0 to 20, but skips odd numbers using the `continue` statement.

## Assignment 2: Find the First Even Number
- **Objective**: Write a JavaScript script that uses a `for` loop to identify the first even number in an array of integers. Use the `break` statement to exit the loop as soon as the first even number is found.
- **Requirements**:
	- **Array Setup**: Define an array containing a mixture of even and odd integers.
	- **Search Logic**: Traverse the array to find the first even number.
	- **Exit Condition**: Use the `break` statement to exit the loop immediately when the first even number is detected.
