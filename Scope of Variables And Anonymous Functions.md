## Scope of Variables, Anonymous Functions, and Best Practices in JavaScript

### Introduction

In JavaScript, variables have a defined scope that determines where they can be accessed in your program. Additionally, understanding anonymous functions and how to follow best practices for naming and modularizing code will help you write more maintainable and readable code.

### Key Concepts and Definitions

### Scope of Variables: Global vs. Local

In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables and functions in different parts of your code. Variables can be classified into two main categories based on their scope: local scope and global scope.

#### Global Scope

- Variables declared outside of any function have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
- They remain in memory throughout the execution of the program.

##### Example:
```js
let globalVar = "I'm global!";

function showGlobal() {
  console.log(globalVar);  // Can access globalVar from inside the function
}

showGlobal();  // Output: I'm global!
```

#### Local Scope

- Variables declared inside a function or block (with `let` or `const`) are said to have **local scope**. They can only be accessed from within the function or block where they are defined.
- They are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function finishes executing.

##### Example:
```js
function showLocal() {
  let localVar = "I'm local!";
  console.log(localVar);  // Accessible only inside the function
}

showLocal();  // Output: I'm local!
console.log(localVar);  // Error: localVar is not defined
```

#### Block Scope

Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside curly braces (`{}`) are block-scoped. They are accessible only within the block in which they are defined.

##### Example:
```js
{
  let blockScoped = "Inside block";
  console.log(blockScoped);  // Accessible within this block
}

console.log(blockScoped);  // Error: blockScoped is not defined
```

### Function Scope vs. Block Scope

- **Function Scope**: Variables declared with `var` inside a function are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible throughout the function, but not outside it.
- **Block Scope**: Variables declared with `let` or `const` are block-scoped, meaning they are accessible only within the block in which they are declared.

##### Example of Block Scope:
```js
if (true) {
  let blockVar = "I'm block-scoped!";
  console.log(blockVar);  // Output: I'm block-scoped!
}

console.log(blockVar);  // Error: blockVar is not defined
```

##### Example of Function Scope:
```js
function exampleFunction() {
  var functionScopedVar = "I'm function-scoped!";
  console.log(functionScopedVar);
}

exampleFunction();  // Output: I'm function-scoped!
console.log(functionScopedVar);  // Error: functionScopedVar is not defined
```

#### Scope Chain

When a variable is called inside a function, JavaScript first looks for the variable in the current function scope. If it doesn't find it, it goes up the scope chain to the outer scope, continuing until it reaches the global scope.

##### Example of Scope Chain:
```js
let globalVar = "Global";

function outerFunction() {
  let outerVar = "Outer";

  function innerFunction() {
    let innerVar = "Inner";
    console.log(globalVar);  // Access globalVar from global scope
    console.log(outerVar);   // Access outerVar from outerFunction scope
    console.log(innerVar);   // Access innerVar from innerFunction scope
  }

  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
```
