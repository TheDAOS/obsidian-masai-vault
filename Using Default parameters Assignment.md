## Default Parameter in Function

**Objective**: Write a JavaScript function that calculates the tip on a restaurant bill. The function should have a default tip rate if none is provided by the user.

*Requirements*:
- Define a function named ``calculateTip`` that takes two parameters: `billAmount` and `tipRate`.
- `tipRate` should have a default value of 15% (i.e., 0.15).
- The function should calculate the total tip amount based on the `billAmount` and `tipRate`, and return this value.
- Call this function twice: first, by passing only the bill amount to use the default tip rate, and second, by passing both the bill amount and a custom tip rate to see the function's flexibility.
