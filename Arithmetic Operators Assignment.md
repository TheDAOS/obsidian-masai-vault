### Question-1:
Given a number N, find its cube.
- Sample Input
	```js
	2
	```
- Sample Output
	```js
	8
	```
### Question-2:
You are given five numbers stored in variables with the following names
```js
one, two, three, four, five
```
Print the sum of the five values stored in the variables `one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five= 5` 

- Sample Input:
	```js
	1 2 3 4 5
	```
- Sample Output
	```js
	15
	```
- In the sample test case, the values stored in the variables are `one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five= 5`
- The sum of the values is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`, which is the required sum
### Question-3:
Given a number `X`, perform the following operations
1. Multiply `X` by `3`.
2. Add `10` to the result.
Calculate the final value of `X` after performing these operations.

- Sample Input
	```js
	3
	```
- Sample Output
	```js
	19
	```

**Explanation**
The value of `X = 3`, after multiplying with `3`, `X` becomes `9`, and then after adding `10`, it becomes `19`. So, the output is `19`
