[[Apriori Analysis vs Posteriori Analysis]]

1. Algorithms T.C is very much related to functions in maths
2. The following functions are commonly used in Algorithms

|Sno|Function Name|Function
###### best < worst
O(1) < O(log n) < O(root n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n^2) < O(n^3) < O(2^n)

| Time Complexity | Function Representation |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
|                 |                         |

order of 1 is the best time complexity that we there is no time complexity less than or smaller that order of 1.
