Some popular Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems related to stacks:

### 1. Balanced Parentheses:
   - Check if a given string of parentheses is balanced. For example, `()[]{}` is balanced, but `([)]` is not.

### 2. Next Greater Element:
   - For each element in an array, find the next greater element to its right. If there is no greater element, return -1.

### 3. Evaluate Postfix Expression:
   - Evaluate a postfix expression using a stack. For example, evaluate the expression "231*+9-".

### 4. Implement Queue using Stacks:
   - Implement a queue using two stacks. The queue should support the standard queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, front, isEmpty).

### 5. Sort a Stack:
   - Sort a stack using recursion or an auxiliary stack. The sorted order can be either ascending or descending.

### 6. Largest Rectangle in Histogram:
   - Given an array of integers representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the largest rectangle that can be formed by these bars.

### 7. Stock Span Problem:
   - For each day in a stock's price list, calculate the span of the stock's price. The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (including today) for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to the price today.

### 8. Two Stacks in an Array:
   - Implement two stacks in a single array. The array should be used efficiently to store elements of both stacks.

### 9. Minimum Cost to Make Array Non-Decreasing:
   - Given an array of integers, find the minimum cost to make the array non-decreasing by removing elements.

### 10. Trapping Rain Water:
- Given an array of integers representing the height of buildings, calculate the amount of rainwater trapped between the buildings.
