## Introduction
Nested loops are loops within loops, and they are particularly useful for scenarios that involve repeated iterations, such as printing patterns. In pattern printing, the outer loop controls the rows, while the inner loop controls the columns. This combination allows you to create complex patterns, such as triangles, squares, and other shapes.

## Key Concepts and Definitions

### What is a Nested Loop?
A **nested loop** is when one loop (inner loop) is placed inside another loop (outer loop). The inner loop completes all of its iterations before the outer loop moves to its next iteration.
