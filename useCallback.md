`useCallback` is a React hook that is used to memoize callback functions. This means that the function will only be recreated if one of its dependencies changes, which can help prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve the performance of your application. This is particularly useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.

In summary, `useCallback` is a powerful tool for optimizing the performance of functional components in React by memoizing callback functions. However, it should be used thoughtfully to avoid potential pitfalls.

### Syntax

```javascript
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  // Function body
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);
```

- `() => { ... }`: The callback function to be memoized.
- `[dependency1, dependency2]`: An array of dependencies. The callback function will only be recreated if one of these dependencies changes.

### Example

Let's consider an example where we have a component that uses a callback function:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered');
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
});

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Button clicked');
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means the function is only created once

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick} />
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Type something"
      />
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ParentComponent />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Explanation

1. **Memoized Callback**: The `handleClick` function is memoized using `useCallback`. The empty dependency array `[]` means the function is only created once, on the initial render.
2. **Child Component**: `ChildComponent` is wrapped with `React.memo`, so it will only re-render if the `onClick` prop changes. Since `handleClick` is memoized, it does not change on subsequent renders, preventing unnecessary re-renders of `ChildComponent`.
3. **State Management**: The `count` and `text` states are managed independently. Changing the `text` state does not affect the `handleClick` function or the rendering of `ChildComponent`.

### Benefits

- **Performance Optimization**: By memoizing the callback function, `useCallback` can significantly improve the performance of your application, especially in scenarios with frequent re-renders.
- **Readability**: It makes the code more readable by clearly indicating which callbacks should be memoized.

### Caveats

- **Overuse**: Overusing `useCallback` can lead to code that is harder to maintain and understand. It should be used judiciously, only for callbacks that are genuinely performance-critical.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure that the dependencies array is correctly specified. Missing dependencies can lead to stale closures, while including unnecessary dependencies can negate the performance benefits.

### When to Use `useCallback`

- **Passing Callbacks to Memoized Components**: When passing callbacks to child components that are wrapped with `React.memo`, using `useCallback` can prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Avoiding Stale Closures**: When the callback function relies on variables that change over time, using `useCallback` with the correct dependencies can help avoid stale closures.
