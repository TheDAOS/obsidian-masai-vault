## Question-1: Check Divisibility by 4 Using Ternary Operators

- You are given a number stored in a variable named `num`.
- Print `Yes` if the number is divisible by 4, else print `No`.

**Note**: A number is divisible by 4 `if num % 4 == 0`.

##### Input:
- The input contains a single positive integer `num`, where `num < 100000`.

##### Output:
- Print `Yes` if `num` is divisible by 4, otherwise print `No`.

##### Sample Input:
```js
12
```

##### Sample Output:
```js
Yes
```

- In the sample test case, the value stored in the variable `num` is `12`.
- Since `12 % 4 = 0`, it is divisible by 4, hence the output is `Yes`.

## Question-2: Print Grade Using Ternary Operators

- You are given a number stored in a variable named `total`.
- Based on the value of `total`, print a grade as follows:
	- If `total == 100`, print "A".
	- If `total >= 90`, print "B".
	- If `total >= 80`, print "C".
	- Otherwise, print "F".

##### Input:
- The input contains a single integer which represents the total marks.

##### Constraints:
- `total`
