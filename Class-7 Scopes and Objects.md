## 1. `let` and `const` Declarations: Block Scoping Rules

`let` and `const` were introduced in **ES6** and differ from the traditional `var` in that they follow **block scoping**.

### Block Scoping
Variables declared with `let` or `const` are scoped to the block in which they are defined, which means they are only accessible inside the pair of `{}` where they were declared.
