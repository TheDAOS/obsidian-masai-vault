The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) is a relatively recent addition to JavaScript, enhancing the language's capability to handle `null` and `undefined` values effectively. This operator provides a more precise alternative to the logical OR (`||`) operator, especially when distinguishing between falsy values and nullish values is necessary.

### Basics of Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`)
- **Syntax**: `result = a ?? b`
- **Behavior**:
	- The expression `a ?? b` evaluates to `a` if `a` is not `null` or `undefined`.
	- If `a` is `null` or `undefined`, it evaluates to `b`.

### Detailed Explanation
The nullish coalescing operator treats `null` and `undefined` similarly, considering them as "not defined." Its primary use is to provide a default value when dealing with potentially null or undefined variables.

**Example Usage:**
```js
let user;
console.log(user ?? "Anonymous"); // Outputs: "Anonymous" because user is undefined

let user = "John";
console.log(user ?? "Anonymous"); // Outputs: "John" because user is defined

let score;
console.log(score ?? 0); // Outputs: 0

score = 25;
console.log(score ?? 0); // Outputs: 25

let name = null;

let fullName = name ?? "Anonymous";
console.log(fullName); // Outputs: "Anonymous"

let quantity;
console.log(quantity ?? 10); // Outputs: 10 - Default quantity is 10

quantity = 0;
console.log(quantity ?? 10); // Outputs: 0 - Quantity is defined as zero
```
