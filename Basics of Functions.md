## Create a JavaScript Function
We can create a function in JavaScript using the `function` keyword:

```js
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

#### Create a JavaScript Function

- Here, we have created a simple function named `greet()` that prints `Hello World!` on the screen.

Our function contains the following parts:
- **Function Keyword** - The `function` keyword is used to create the function.
- **Function Name** - The name of the function is `greet`, followed by parentheses `()`.
- **Function Body** - The code that is executed when we call the function. In our case, it is `console.log("Hello World!")`;

## Call a Function
Previously, we declared a function named `greet()`:

```js
function greet() {
   console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

If we run the above code, we won't get any output. But why?

It's because creating a function doesn't mean we are executing the code inside it. In other words, the function is ready and available for us to execute whenever we choose.

And if we want to use the function, we need to call it.

##### Function Call
```js
greet();
```

As you can see, we call a function by writing the function name (greet) followed by parentheses `()`.
